Whether you're tracking competitor prices, building prospect lists, or pulling research data, the right no-code scraper changes everything. This guide walks through the platforms doing the heavy lifting for sales teams, marketers, researchers, and anyone tired of copy-pasting data by hand.

## [Browse AI](https://www.browse.ai)

Cloud-based automation turning any website into live spreadsheets and APIs without writing code.

![Browse AI Screenshot](image/browse.webp)


Browse AI has carved out serious credibility since launching in 2021, now serving over 500,000 users worldwide who've automated 29 million tasks. The platform centers on teaching "robots" to scrape through a visual point-and-click workflow—no scripts, no XPath selectors. Once trained, these robots handle pagination, infinite scroll, login-protected content, and dynamic JavaScript automatically.

What makes Browse AI stand out is how it adapts to website changes. Most scrapers break when a site updates its layout, forcing you back to square one. Browse AI monitors page structure shifts and self-adjusts extraction logic, cutting maintenance to near zero. You also get built-in scheduling, so robots run hourly, daily, or on custom intervals—feeding fresh data to Google Sheets, APIs, or 7,000+ apps via Zapier and Make integrations.

Real users highlight Browse AI's ability to handle tricky scenarios: price monitoring across e-commerce sites, scraping LinkedIn company data for lead gen, pulling job listings from multiple boards, and extracting real estate listings at scale. The Chrome extension simplifies setup further—visit a page, click what you need, and Browse AI generates the scraper instantly. Prebuilt templates for popular sites (Amazon, LinkedIn, Google Maps) let you extract data in two clicks. Plus, managed services handle complex projects when you need custom scrapers built and maintained by their team.

## [Apify](https://www.apify.com)

Developers get an open-source SDK (Crawlee) for building sophisticated Python or JavaScript scrapers, plus cloud infrastructure handling millions of pages daily.

The platform shines at enterprise scale. One retail analytics company migrated 70 scrapers to Apify, scaled from 2 million to 5 million pages scraped per day, and cut AWS costs by 90%. Apify's proxy rotation, browser automation, and anti-blocking tools prevent bans automatically. Data exports to JSON, CSV, or feeds directly into Google Sheets, databases, and CRMs. Scheduling, monitoring, and webhooks keep workflows automated.

Octoparse built its reputation on making complex scraping simple. The visual workflow designer lets you interact with a built-in browser, clicking data to extract—each action becomes a flowchart block you can debug and adjust. AI-powered Auto-Detection scans page structure and proposes complete workflows including pagination in one click, perfect for non-technical users. For trickier jobs, manual mode handles AJAX, infinite scroll, dropdown menus, and login walls with configurable wait times and form fills.

Cloud scraping runs tasks on Octoparse servers 24/7, so your computer stays free. Built-in IP rotation and CAPTCHA solving (on higher plans) prevent blocks. Data exports to Excel, CSV, JSON, or directly into MySQL, MongoDB, and Google Sheets. Templates for Amazon, Twitter, Yelp, Zillow, and hundreds of other sites let you start extracting immediately.

Kadoa's AI agents figure out how to navigate the site, extract data, clean it, and structure it automatically.
